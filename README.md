Project 1 Summary - Microsoft is considering its ability to enter into the movie production industry. This project analyses the feasibility of current movies in the box office and how to best enter it. We will primarily consider the Return on Investment (RoI) verses other factors. RoI varies through many factors, with the most influential being the genre and release date. Microsoft can use this report to consider its focus on selection of movie scripts and timing of release.

Business Objective Microsoft seeks actionable insights that the head of Microsoft’s new movie studio would be able to use in decision making. Microsoft may be able to improve its focus on movie script selection and apply a targeted release schedule to increase the likelihood of a successful entry to the movie production industry. Considering historical data will allow Microsoft to better understand the market conditions and limit risk when investigating the types of movies to investigate and release schedule.

Results The most successful movies released, considering all the data provided, is of the Horror genre. This genre, historically, can produce high RoI with minimal losses recorded. It is assumed that this high RoI is due to a low production cost. This could be impacted by not using high profile actors thus reducing this cost and/or lower costs of computerized graphic interphases as found in other high gross revenue genres. Microsoft should also consider other secondary genres, specifically drama, mystery and thriller, as standouts to improve results for the success of a horror genre movies. The Horror genre has been most consistently successful in June. Compared to the general gross revenue across all genres raises questions as to why the Horror genre hasn’t performed well in the February or November periods that show a high RoI for all genre.

Conclusions The most successful movies released, considering all the data provided, is of the Horror genre, this genre, historically, can produce high RoI with minimal losses recorded. Adding a sub genre to the selection of movie including drama, mystery and/or thriller will increase likelihood of a high RoI Microsoft should target release in June period where horror movies, traditionally, fare better at the box office.

Next steps: Engage directors and/or producers who have been involved with high RoI horror movies for advice on script selection. Analyse reviews and popularity vs actors to see if there are any correlations to increased RoI Source increased data from the movie database that specifies primary genre as this would increase the data sets and ability to analyse.
